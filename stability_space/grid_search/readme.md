The grid was dividied into subgrids and the search was performed on an HPC. The subgrids and submission files are not included but can be requested. The executed function to obtain the results for each compositon is provided in the script 'diss_func.py'. The full grid search results are given in 'grid_data.csv' providing the initial (111) surface composition (isc), the final (111) surface compositon (fsc), dissolved composition (d), and Sd.
